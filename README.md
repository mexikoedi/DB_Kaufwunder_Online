This is a simple PHP/Database connection with a website interface which I programmed to learn a bit more about PHP and SQL. Many things (or everything) is in German and this was only made to learn more about PHP and SQL.

### You need Xampp! Here: https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html

You can donwload it if you select the green button named "Code" then "Download ZIP" or donwload the ZIP file over the releases tab. Extract the downloaded zip folder, move the "kaufwunder_online" folder to "<Your drive>:...\xampp\mysql\data" and move the other files to "<Your drive>:...\xampp\htdocs" (You can put the files in a folder first to move them easier.)
