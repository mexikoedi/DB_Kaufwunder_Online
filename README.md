# DB_Kaufwunder_Online
This is a simple PHP/Database connection with a website interface which I programmed to learn a bit more about PHP and SQL. Many things (or everything) is in German and this was only made to learn more about PHP and SQL.

You can download it if you select the green button named "Code" then "Download ZIP" or download the ZIP file over the releases tab. Extract the downloaded zip folder, move the "kaufwunder_online" folder to "<Your drive>:...\xampp\mysql\data" and move the other files to "<Your drive>:...\xampp\htdocs" (You can put the files in a folder first to move them easier.)

  
Feel free to add a pull request or an issue. I might learn something from it because I am still learning.
